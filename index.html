                <p>Aspire to hire better Customise your recruitment process from end-to-end. Hire candidates based on collaborative data. Profile your company like never before. And save tons of HR time.</p>

                <p>Companies we have studied include major companies as well as startups like Biocon, Aisle, Emkay Global, VibeApp, IBM, Papercats, Carrealism, TCS and several others.</p>

                <h3>Calibrations</h3>

                <p>The first step in landing your dream candidate is figuring out who exactly you’re looking for. Jobspire gives you complete control over the hiring criteria for each job — skills, traits, qualifications, as well as custom categories unique to your organization. You can be as specific as you need for every position, or you can sit back and let our system give you a generic listing based on your company profile, in a single click!</p>

                <p>Each job posting is different and you can customize the application form to get the information you want. You can also rank candidates based on their answers, allowing you to get to the best candidates quicker. We also parse resumes and extract keywords if you want to match those too. We have several in-house machine learning enthusiasts. In due time, we want to be able to convert any resume into a digital, sortable and filterable system.</p>

                <p>We also streamline the process by bringing each new application front and center, showing you a candidate’s resumé and their responses to application questions,  so you can quickly move the best talent forward and reject the rest.</p>
