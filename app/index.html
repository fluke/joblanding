                Aspire to hire better Customise your recruitment process from end-to-end. Hire candidates based on collaborative data. Profile your company like never before. And save tons of HR time. 

                Companies we have studied include major companies as well as startups like Biocon, Aisle, Emkay Global, VibeApp, IBM, Papercats, Carrealism, TCS and several others.

                <!-- Calibrations

                The first step in landing your dream candidate is figuring out who exactly you’re looking for. Jobspire gives you complete control over the hiring criteria for each job — skills, traits, qualifications, as well as custom categories unique to your organization. You can be as specific as you need for every position, or you can sit back and let our system give you a generic listing based on your company profile, in a single click!

                Each job posting is different and you can customize the application form to get the information you want. You can also rank candidates based on their answers, allowing you to get to the best candidates quicker. We also parse resumes and extract keywords if you want to match those too. We have several in-house machine learning enthusiasts. In due time, we want to be able to convert any resume into a digital, sortable and filterable system.

                We also streamline the process by bringing each new application front and center, showing you a candidate’s resumé and their responses to application questions,  so you can quickly move the best talent forward and reject the rest.

                Stage Planner

                Different jobs require different skills and traits from the ideal candidate, and your interview plan should be just as unique. 

                Planning on finding a rockstar UX designer? Build a design exercise with your team into the process. 

                Looking for a developer? Integrate a testing platform like HackerRank or give a take-home assignment for later evaluation. 

                Our stage planner lets you tailor the hiring process for every position. 

                Set up your hiring flow

                Modules

                What we call our gamebreaker, are plug and play “responses” that you can include in each stage. Want to send an email response to the candidate when he or she applies to a job? How about saving all candidates to a Dropbox folder or Google Drive when a candidate reaches a particular stage or is rejected, but saved for later? Want to automate sending a rejection letter? Welcome to Jobspire Modules — the next big thing in HR automation. 

                Modules essentially are a way of automating repetitive tasks in a simple but powerful way. This time is better utilized interviewing potential employees or taking a well-earned break.

                Scheduler

                We allow Interviewers to mark out their schedules, so that setting up and following up on interviews is a breeze. Our scheduling system can automate all this and it also allows you to keep track of who’s interviewing who and when, all at a single glance. As well as allowing you to set up future appointments and look at the reviews from previous interviews.

                With the headache of keeping track of schedules and making them fit into your flow gone, your team can focus on finding the right talent.


                Interview Cards


                With Jobspire, it’s easy to plan out the purpose of every interview, keeping your interviewers focused on the key areas and making it easier to tell if they missed anything afterwards. The interviewee is also kept up to date on the details of the interview. 

                Whether your process involvement multiple interviews, each covering a different aspect or one thorough interview touching all key points, Jobspire allows you to plan and keep track of the process. Both the candidate and the recruiter receive emails with details about the next interview as well as 10 minutes before the interview, informing them about the next stage — fully leveraging your recruiter’s calendar. Recruiters are emailed an innovative “Interview Card” — a single link where you can see all the candidate data, their past scores and get to scoring them on the interview right away!

                Pipeline

                Have a birds eye view of the people who’ve applied to your job posting. Look at their current position in the hiring pipeline, and their scores in the different stages. This will keep you informed on who the best performers are, how many candidates are nearing the final stage, etc.

                You don’t have to monitor this manually though. Our system will automatically send you alerts if a candidate has been a stage too long. Or needs to have an interview scheduled. Or is having an interview soon. This gives you a lot of information in a simple way helping you understand your current progress and what you need to go about doing next. 

                Team Organization

                Jobspire lets you configure approvals for individual jobs, entire offices and departments. So, you can keep people accountable and not worry about mishaps. Approvals are required at different stages such as when a job is drafted, when it’s made public and when an offer is made to a candidate. 

                Segregate your hiring team into different groups (Sourcers, Interviewers and Admins) and set what they’re permitted to do.

                Sketches

                The Sketch is a simple system that consists of the candidate profile, their scores in the interviews and what other recruiters for this job have said about the candidate. Scoring also happen here and you can only see other recruiter’s scores after you’ve score the candidates yourself. Yup, we just threw bias out of the window.

                The scoring system is a simple graded system allowing you to assess candidates based on the attributes, qualities and skills you’d like them to possess. A side by side comparison of candidates based on this system allows you to make better decisions.

                Employer Branding


                Did you know that a single, well placed story can steal your best employee? Profile your company like never before and attract the best talent on the market.
